          gm.
Iâ€™m free4fun.
Fullstack developer.
White belt in the arts of blockchain.</p>
<p>
Driven by an obsession with decentralized technology.
Born almost by accident in a horizon full of digital noise.
Once I saw the magnitude of this crypto-philosophical engine.
I moved forward without pause in its direction.</p>
<p>
I design digital experiences that are transparent and secure.
Control returns to the hands of the user.
With the mix of frontend and backend in my arsenal.
I translate encrypted chain logic into clear interfaces.
I enjoy deciphering challenges.
From smart contract architectures.
To squeezing every drop of performance out of a dApp.</p>
<p>
When I leave the keyboard, I stay connected.
Tracking mutations of the crypto ecosystem.
Contributing to open-source projects.
Finding inspiration in the cyberpunk vision.
Always focused on building the decentralized future.</p>
